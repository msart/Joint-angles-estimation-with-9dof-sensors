# Joint-angles-estimation-with-9dof-sensors

The arduino code and the processing visualizator are just minor modifications from Adafruit sensor fusion example from their library and Madgwick visualizator to work together.

The julia code is a traduction from the c open source AHRS implementation from Madgwick, but is in construction.

In the python source directory you can find the working implementation of angle estimation.

There is a simple implementation of a fuzz effect in Puredata plug and play for a bass or guitar.
