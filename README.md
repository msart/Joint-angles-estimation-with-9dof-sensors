# Joint-angles-estimation-with-9dof-sensors

The arduino code and the processing visualizator are just minor modifications from Adafruit sensor fusion example from their library and Madgwick visualizator to work together.
The julia code is a traduction from the c open source AHRS implementation from Madgwick, but is in construction.
In the python source directory you can find the working implementation
